Understanding Functions through Arrays ---Pradnya Ithape

a) Write a recursive function named SumArray that calculates and returns the sum of elements in an array.
demonstarte with example.

public class SumArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int sum = sumArray(array);
        System.out.println("Sum of elements in the array: " + sum);
    }

    public static int sumArray(int[] array) {
        if (array.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            int firstElement = array[0];
            int[] restOfArray = new int[array.length - 1];
            System.arraycopy(array, 1, restOfArray, 0, array.length - 1);
            return firstElement + sumArray(restOfArray);
        }
    }
}


Demonstration with the same example :-

You define an example array containing the integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
You call the sumArray function with this array as an argument.
Inside the sumArray function, it checks if the length of the array is 0. Since it's not, it proceeds to the recursive case.
It extracts the first element of the array (which is 1) and creates a new array restOfArray containing the remaining elements {2, 3, 4, 5}.
It recursively calls the sumArray function with the restOfArray.
Inside the recursive call, it repeats the process until the length of the array becomes 0.
When the length of the array becomes 0, it returns 0 (base case).
The recursive calls start to return, each adding the first element of their respective arrays to the sum.
Finally, the initial call to sumArray returns the sum of all elements in the array, which is printed as "Sum of elements in the array: 15".
