Assignment 3: 

Research and compare SDLC models suitable for engineering projects. 
Present findings on Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model approaches, emphasizing their advantages, disadvantages, 
and applicability in different engineeringÂ contexts.


1. Waterfall Model:
   - Advantages:
     - Easy to understand and use, as it follows a sequential approach.
     - Well suited for projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
     - Each phase has specific deliverables, making it easy to measure progress.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Lack of flexibility; once a phase is completed, it's difficult to go back and make changes.
     - Not ideal for projects with evolving or unclear requirements.
     - Testing is done at the end, which may lead to higher risks of finding defects late in the process.
   - Applicability: Best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and stable technology.

2. Agile Model:
   - Advantages:
     - Highly flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
     - Promotes collaboration and customer involvement throughout the development process.
     - Allows for early and frequent delivery of working software.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Requires active customer involvement, which might not always be feasible.
     - Lack of emphasis on documentation might lead to issues in maintaining and understanding the system.
     - Initial setup may require more time due to the need for continuous integration and testing frameworks.
   - Applicability: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements or where rapid delivery is crucial.

3. Spiral Model:
   - Advantages:
     - Incorporates elements of both waterfall and prototyping models, offering flexibility and risk management.
     - Allows for early identification and mitigation of risks.
     - Suitable for large and complex projects where risks need to be managed effectively.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Can be complex to manage due to its iterative nature.
     - Requires considerable expertise to identify and mitigate risks effectively.
     - May result in higher costs and longer development time due to the iterative cycles.
   - Applicability: Best suited for large-scale projects with high levels of uncertainty and associated risks.

4. V-Model:
   - Advantages:
     - Corresponds each stage of the development process with a testing phase, ensuring thorough verification and validation.
     - Helps in early detection and correction of defects.
     - Provides a clear and systematic approach to development and testing.
   - Disadvantages:
     - Can be rigid and less adaptable to changes compared to Agile or Spiral models.
     - Requires detailed documentation and planning upfront.
     - Testing activities may get delayed until the development phase is complete, leading to potential integration issues.
   - Applicability: Suitable for projects with well-understood requirements and where testing is critical.
