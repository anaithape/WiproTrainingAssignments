Assignment 2: Draw your Home Network Topology and explain how you are accessing the RPS Lab environment.

Internet Router: This is the main router connecting your home network to the internet. 
It manages incoming and outgoing traffic.

Laptop, Smartphone, Smart TV: These devices are connected to the home network either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. 
They can access the internet and communicate with each other within the local network.

Access Point: Provides wireless connectivity to devices in the home network. 
It connects to the router and extends the Wi-Fi coverage area.


Accessing the RPS Lab Environment:

To access the RPS Lab environment from your home network, 
you would typically need to connect to it using a remote access method such as VPN (Virtual Private Network) or 
SSH (Secure Shell) tunneling:

VPN: You can set up a VPN connection from your home network to the RPS Lab network. 
This creates a secure tunnel over the internet, allowing you to access resources in the lab environment 
as if you were physically there.

SSH Tunneling: If the RPS Lab environment allows SSH access, you can establish an SSH tunnel from your home network 
to a server in the lab. Through this tunnel, you can securely access lab resources and services
